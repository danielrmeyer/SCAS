# SCAS (Scala Computer Alebra System)

* Goal is to create a computer alebra sysem with unit awareness.
* Fundamental quantity will be Real or Complex valued numbers with a physical dimension or unitless.
* Complex mathematical expressions will have units determined at compile time and only physically meaningful calculations will be conducted at runtime.
* System must be fast and scale.
* Using Coulomb units library.
* Trying to take the best parts of smile.cas and galileo.
* System must be powerful enought to encode structure and interpretation of classical mechanics.
* If this sounds interesting please send me an email at daniel@offgridcompute.com
